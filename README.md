# XML Editor

This is a Qt-based main window application for XML file editing. It allows you to create new XML files, open existing files, save files and exit the application. It also has features for compressing, decompressing and converting XML files to JSON. The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easy to use. This project is a final project for Data Structures and Algorithms (CSE331s) and is developed by a group of students.
